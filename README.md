# groundwork
Project start point with React // React Router // Webpack // Gulp // SASS // Yarn


## Installation
1. Clone repo
2. ```$ yarn install```

## Development

```$ gulp```
The default gulp task will watch your files and serve your pages with Browsersync.

Generate new React components with ```gulp new-component```. You'll be prompted for a name for the component. React router uses components as the base for a route too, so I'd recommend giving them a name that begins with route/layout/page etc.

You'll also get prompted as to whether you'd like a stateful or stateless component. Select one with spacebar. Stateless will have SASS files, stateful won't.
