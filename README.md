# groundwork
Project start point with React // React Router // Webpack // Gulp // SASS // Yarn


## Installation
1. Clone repo
2. ```$ yarn install```

## Development

```$ gulp```
The default gulp task will watch your files and serve your pages with Browsersync.

Generate new React components with ```gulp new-component```. You'll be prompted for a name for the component. React router uses components as the base for a route too, so I'd recommend giving them a name that begins with route/layout/page etc.

Hopefully it's useful to you. I'm making it up as I go along... :)
